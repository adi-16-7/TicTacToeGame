# TicTacToeGame
A basic tic tac toe game written in django. I have used django channels for websocket functionalities as its supported by django out of the box. The front end is made using html css and javascript. The event based programming is on the js end, whereas the socket based logic is being handled on the django end. 

To see the working, you can clone this repository and initialize a virtualenv, install all the dependencies by installing the requirements.txt and then simply hit the runserver command in django.
Go to your browser and open the localhost, the server is hosted on, and post that, its a pretty graphical user interface to proceed further. once you enter a playing room, copy the url and change the option while pasting it in incognito to see the 2 player functionality in action.
